    description:
      "The Seat Reservation System is a full-stack web application designed to manage seat bookings within an organization. Built using React.js on the frontend and Node.js/Express on the backend, the system enables employees or trainees to book, cancel, and manage seat reservations based on their assigned working floor. The frontend interface is rich with features such as a date picker, drag-and-drop seat allocation, QR code generation for check-ins, and export functionalities for reports in PDF and CSV formats. Authentication is handled via Google Sign-In using OAuth2, and task-critical emails like confirmations and cancellations are sent via Nodemailer. On the backend, MongoDB is used to persist booking data, and sessions are managed securely using express-session. Admin users have capabilities to view seat usage, manage holidays, and export attendance records. This project gave me in-depth experience with integrating complex frontend components and building secure, scalable backend APIs for enterprise use.",
